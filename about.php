                         <p> I wanted to learn a new development language called PHP and what better
                    way to learn than develop something constructive.</p> 
                         <p>The maintenance process in our complex is well .... complex!!.<br><br>
                    There are too many channels to report a problem: Security, Manager, Phone call to workman, Log book 
                    and all this leads to confusion and delays in delivering the service.</p>
                    A Help desk of this kind should streamline complaints and result in more efficiency (hopefully)

                            not get service within 48 hrs, please contact the manager & quote your reference id.</p>
